# csvloader
Built to parse a specific set of CSV-files corresponding to a specific database.
The format of these files is a bit impractical why this script attempts to do some rudimentary type-inference
and data-massaging. For general purpose you are probably better of using the
[Pandas CSV-reader](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html#io-store-in-csv).
But if you need to tweak your own, this reader might be an option.

This library is still a work in progress
